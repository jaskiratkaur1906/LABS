## Goals & Learnings

| Lab | Goals | Key Learnings |
|-----|-------|--------------|
| **Lab 1** – Intro to ZYNQ ZC702 | Familiarize with ZC702 board, tools (PlanAhead, XPS, SDK), and run “Hello World.” | Hardware config in XPS, export to SDK, run C/C++ on board, view terminal output. |
| **Lab 2** – Memory-Mapped I/O | Implement memory-mapped I/O with GPIO to interface LEDs & switches. | Set up GPIO in XPS, code to read inputs/control outputs via registers. |
| **Lab 3** – AXI Hardware Timer | Configure AXI Timer in PWM mode, understand registers & timing. | Timer setup in PWM, troubleshoot SDK, control/status register usage. |
| **Lab 4** – Interrupts with AXI Timer | Implement ARM interrupts triggered by AXI Timer. | Write ISRs in C/C++, connect AXI Timer to ARM IRQ, handle async events. |
